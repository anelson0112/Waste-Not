/*For the User schema: Pros and cons of developing the documents in XML vs JSON- 
There are many advantages of developing the documents in JSON. JSON is much more readable 
than XML. For XML, you are required to create custom tags for each item (i.e.<password></password>), whereas
JSON is similiar to JavaScript objects (i.e. key/value pairs). JSON also uses a map data strucutre,
which is much more readable and intuitive than XML's tree structure. The biggest con of XML 
is that it has to be parsed with a XML parser, where JSON can be parsed by a Javascript function (json.parse(string))
and saved to a variable. Lastly, JSON can use arrays, whereas XML cannot. All in all, JSON will be a 
much better fit for the User schema, as it will allow us to easily manipulate and use the data with JavaScript. */
