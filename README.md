OOP:

Encapsulation: reusing the same objects for everything but limiting access to the different parts, will only need to make 3 objects that can be reused for all the needs. See also KISS and DRY.

Abstraction: by using fewer objects and limiting access to the parts, it decreates the complexity and allows a safety net for impact of change by users that don't meed to be changing things.

Inheritance: All the code is being written once, and permissions allow access the parts.

PolyMorphism: Same thing, with permissions, ability to override the basic parts. Also, my using different objects it overrides the need for if/else making things more readable.
